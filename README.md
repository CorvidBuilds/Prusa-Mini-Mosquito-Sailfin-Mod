# Prusa Mini Mosquito Sailfin Mod
![Assembly](https://github.com/CorvidBuilds/Prusa-Mini-Voron-M4-Mount/blob/main/images/Aseembly.png)
I've been using 4nthonylin's [Mosquito Mount](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/36643-prusa-mini-mosquito-mount) and [Fan Shroud](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/37368-prusa-mini-mosquito-fan-shroud) mods for a long time and I've wanted to experiment with direct drive extruders for almost as long. I considered putting [Annex Engineering's Sherpa Mini](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/32331-prusa-mini-z-axis-bottom-redesign) using [athlon789789's mount](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/66519-prusa-mini-sherpa-extruder-direct-drive-conversion) but [CroXY's Sailfin](https://github.com/CroXY3D/Sailfin-Extruder) looked funnier. After some tinkering, I have created these two mounts.

The Mosquito mount was modified by:

- Removing two nut retainers.
- Removed M6 threading.
- Moved relief to the other side of the feeder hole.

The Sherpa Mini mount was modified by

- Aligning output of extruder with hot end.
- Widening the top plate for said alignment.
- Shortening the overall height by ~3mm.

This mount should fit both the Sherpa Mini and the Sailfin (using the Mid_Sherpa_Mount.stl).
